## MiniFx

Our aim is to produce well structured, modular and maintainable JavaFx applications. At the same time we are not big fans of
re-inventing the weel and overdesigned frameworks which tend to restrict the user rather then assisting her/him; we prefer non-invasive and lightweight approaches which complement each other and reuse the power of existing components, while not restricing the user in any way as soon as things get a bit more 'advanced'. Simple things shall be easy, more complicated ones possible.

MiniFx is a set of libraries which resulted from these considerations. These libraries are maintained within the [minifx](https://github.com/minifx) organization on github. 

Currently, MiniFx consists of the following projects:

|      library      | purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
|[minifx-fxml](https://minifx.org/minifx-fxml)|simplifies loading of fxml files and their controllers using naming conventions|
|[minifx-workbench](https://minifx.org/minifx-workbench)|organizes JavaFx applications in a workbench like manner within spring contexts|
